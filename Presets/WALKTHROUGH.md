## Creating your preset

<details>
  
<summary>Walkthrough</summary></summary>
<ul>
  <li>
    
  Step 1: Create a layout and call it EX - The Bowl Of Embers.
  ![layoutcreation](/docs/images/walkthrough/createlayout.png)
  
  </li>
  
  <li>
    
  Step 2: Add an element and name it something that will enable you to identify which element it is later on.

## Creating a line AOE element

<details>
  
<summary>Walkthrough</summary></summary>

This section will teach you how to create a cone element. For this particular section, we will be using the skill 'Crimson Cyclone'. 

![lines](/docs/images/walkthrough/ifritlines.gif)

Looking at the cast bar, Crimson Cyclone has a cast time of about 3 seconds and the skill moves ifrit along the whole map, so the length is quite long. The width of the skill also looks to be about the size of Ifrits body. You can see that The fact it has a cast time means we can enable the draw to show the second Ifrit begins casting the skill, giving us plenty of time to see the safe spots.
<ul>
  <li>
    
Step 1: Set your element type to 'line relative to object'. This will make the line attach to an object, rather than a set of points on the map.
![coneoption](/docs/images/walkthrough/lineobject.png)</li>

<li>
  
Step2: Find the NPC ID    
 - We need to find the NPC ID to enable splatoon to know which NPC the skill is going to be cast from. In this case, the NPC is Ifrit. Splatoon enables you to grab the NPC ID by targetting the NPC and clicking the target button once you have set the Single attribute to NPC. This shows us that Ifrit has an NPC ID of 0x4A1.
![target](/docs/images/walkthrough/targetoption.png)</li>

<li>
  
Step 3: While casting and Skill ID
 - We need to find the skill ID to enable us to create the element. In this case, we already know that the skill name is Crimson Cyclone, so we can look through our Trigevent log and see that Crimson Cyclone has a skill ID of 1532. For some fights, Splatoon already gives us the ID of the skill when we type it in. By ticking the box next to 'While casting', we are telling Splatoon that we want this element to draw when Ifrit is casting this skill.</li>

<li>

Step 4: Setting the width and length of the element
 - We know that the element has a long range, making it as long as the map puts it at 44. Making it as wide as Ifrit's body makes the radius 6. Particularly in new fights, we have to do some trial and error testing and gathering IDs of skills and NPCs from splatoon's logging feature, which is explained above.
![account for rotation](/docs/images/walkthrough/accountrotate.png)
 - We then want to make Point A have Y:44 (the length) and change the radius to be 6.

If you did everything correctly, your Crimson Cyclone element should draw correctly when Ifrit begins to cast, giving you time to find the safe spots.

## Improving a line AOE element using triggers.

<details>
  
<summary>Walkthrough</summary></summary>

This section will teach you how to expand upon the created line AOE using triggers. 

![ifritlinedraw](/docs/images/walkthrough/ifritlinecomplete.gif)

A big issue with the line AOE created above is that it requires Ifrit to be casting to display. In a mechanic where there are several NPCS that all cast the same spell ID and you are required to find multiple safe spots, it can be tricky. To this end, a trigger can be used to effectively draw ALL of the Ifrit line AOEs at the same time. This can create scenarios where there are evident safe spots within the mechanic that are not usually seen when solving them naturally.

<ul>
  <li>
    
  Step 1: Press the layout name you made earlier and press the group menu at the top of the page.
  
  ![groupname](/docs/images/walkthrough/groupname.png)
  
  </li>
  
  <li>
    
  Step 2: Scroll down to the bottom and type the name you want your grop of elements to be called and press "add".
  
  ![creategroup](/docs/images/walkthrough/creategroup.png)
  
  </li>

  <li>
    
  Step 3: The layout should now be under the group you created. From now on, when creating new layouts, you can assign them to this group so they appear under the heading. This is useful when creating more advanced elements, where some need triggers and some do not.
  
  ![grouped](/docs/images/walkthrough/grouped.png)
  
  </li>

  <li>
    
  Step 4: Change the display condition to "on trigger only" and down the bottom of the page, tick the "Enable Trigger" button. Make sure you change the option to "Show at log message" and put the log message to 1532 - the skill ID for crimson Cyclone.
  
  ![grouped](/docs/images/walkthrough/enabletrigger.png)
  
  </li>

   <li>
    
  Step 5: Now make sure you untick "While casting" and tick "Visible characters only" in the element options as we are now using a trigger rather than a cast to draw these elements.

  </li>
</ul>

If you did all the steps correctly, you should now notice that your elements draw on all of the Ifrits the moment the first begins their cast. This means you can see the safe spots instantly, rather than running around the arena dodging each ifrit!
